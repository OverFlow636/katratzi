Harry Dresden is the only wizard who advertises in the Chicago yellow pages. And he's the real deal. Charms. Potions. Spells even. Dresden is a haunted man (in more ways than one) who has sinned and been sinned against. But in the darkness of his past, he finds an inner strength and a driving desire to set things right. Armed with his trusty staff (okay, it's a hockey stick) and winning personality (if you don't mind the snarky sense of humor), and aided and abetted by his annoying spiritual advisor, Bob (doomed soul, expert in magic, noodge), Dresden champions the underdog against all manner of supernatural threats -- for five hundred dollars a day. Plus expenses. Dresden doesn't do parties and he doesn't do love potions. But if the hocus starts to pocus, if the going gets... strange, if the things that go bump in the night start packing a punch, call him. He's in the book. Based on the best-selling novels by Jim Butcher, The Dresden Files has been described as being a lot like Harry Potter... if Harry Potter had been written by the illegitimate love child of Raymond Chandler and Douglas Adams.",

The Graske (Jimmy Vee) teleports into the TARDIS to warn the Doctor about a space portal that promptly opens in the TARDIS linking it to the Royal Albert Hall during a Proms concert. The Doctor converses with the audience revealing that he played the tuba at the very first Proms, making a joke about Beethoven's deafness and implying that he has met him. The Doctor sends his own sheet music through the portal to the orchestra to have his symphony, Ode to the Universe, played by them. As the orchestra plays the Doctor's symphony conducted by the Doctor himself with his sonic screwdriver, the Graske steals the Doctor's water pistol and uses the portal to get to Earth. The Graske sprays some of the audience in the Royal Albert Hall with water before being pulled back through the portal by the Doctor who reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. The Doctor reverses the teleport and sends the Graske to the other side of the galaxy. The Doctor tells the audience to listen out for the \"Music of the Spheres\" that is all around them before returning to the TARDIS console to close the portal.",

In a great lather the Doctor tells them that the world is endangered and that they need to save the planet now. Suddenly, he realises that they have no idea what he's on about, and goes to leave since he's obviously arrived before any of these Earth-shattering events are happening. After Amy questions his decision, he tells them not to worry, and that everything is safe. While saying this, some clips from \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" are shown, with the Doctor, the Ponds, and others, all facing peril. The Doctor then wishes them a good night's sleep, and flies away. Unable to go back to sleep after this interlude of foreboding doom from the Doctor, the couple are seen in bed staring at the ceiling while Rory remarks \"I really hate it when he does that\".",

The Ponds are then shown eating a cooked breakfast while the Doctor explains on the phone that the Ood was rescued from the middle of the Androvax conflict and was being transported back to the Ood Sphere. When the Doctor asks if the Ood was behaving, clips of the Ood performing housework are shown including making the bed, dispensing Amy's laptop and Rory's lunch for their \"work day experience\", hanging up laundry and cleaning the windows. When Rory questions the Doctor on the Ood's belief he is their butler, he is reassured that the Ood is \"conditioned to serve\" and the best thing to do is to allow him to continue. The Doctor ends the phone call as there's trouble in the TARDIS and as the Ponds hear the Doctor battling with it, they discuss their guilt at the Ood's service.",

He tells them that he dropped the Ood off back home, rode a horse in 11th century Coventry and possibly invented pasta. He also says that he visited them once, but they weren't there. The Doctor then asks if they're all right; then, answering his own question, says that he's foolish to worry and \"The Ponds are always all right\". While saying this, a silent clip of Rory walking away from their house in anger is shown, as well as a clip of Amy walking after him, yelling \"I hate you\", and then crying. The next clip shows the Doctor saying goodbye; then he seems to change his mind, points the sonic screwdriver at the phone and deletes the message that he'd just left. We then see Amy walk inside her house, place some items down and walk up to the phone, seeing if there's a message, which there isn't. She then says that they need their \"raggedy man\", as she referred to him as in \"The Eleventh Hour\"; more specifically, that she, personally, needs the Doctor.",

Both of them were to find unlikely hope and unexpected challenges in the form of a Saturday tea-time drama. Allied with a team of unusual but brilliant people, they went on to create the longest running science fiction series ever made.",

Drawing on the latest theories as well as 200 years of scientific discoveries and the genius of Einstein, Brian tries to answer the classic questions raised by the Doctor - can you really travel in time? Does extra-terrestrial life exist in our galaxy? And how do you build something as fantastical as the TARDIS?",

        "Overview": "Location: London Date: 2008 Enemy: Professor Lazarus It looks as though Martha's odyssey is coming to an end when the Doctor drops her home, even landing the Tardis inside her lounge. But then a TV news report tickles the insatiable curiosity of our gallivanting Gallifreyan, and they're off again. So we're treated to the unusual sight of the Doc in a DJ as he escorts a glammed-up Martha to the launch of a scientific breakthrough: an eternal youth machine created by an elderly professor, Richard Lazarus. As with all weird science, the side effects are severe, but this is a very extreme case (and no, it's not suitable for tots). Doctor Who continues its game of spot the homage. Tonight's story is an enjoyable synthesis of She, The Fly and The Quatermass Experiment - even down to the final battle in a London cathedral. But despite some charming interplay between the two leads and an excellent turn from Mark Gatiss as the young and old professor, The Lazarus Experiment is a pretty conventional runaround, though the nightmarish Identikit creature is superbly realised and dedicated Whovians can look out for a \"reverse the polarity\" reference.",
